# Create new user
create user landmarks_user;

# Create new database
create database landmarks_db;

# Make landmarks_user the owner
alter database landmarks_db owner to landmarks_user;

# Create the two tables with their schemas
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql -U landmarks_user -d landmarks_db -a -f ~/../alice/Downloads/LDV/createdb.sql

\c landmarks_db
COPY description FROM '/home/postgres/description.csv' WITH CSV DELIMITER '|';
COPY landmarks FROM '/home/postgres/landmarks.csv' WITH CSV DELIMITER '|';

# Install psycopg2 to write the python client for postgres/perm

/usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_ctl stop -D /usr/local/pgsql/data -l logfile
